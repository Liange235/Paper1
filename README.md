![图片描述](https://liange235.github.io/Intermediate-results/graphical_abstract_paper1.png)

Code, models and data for the paper ["Neural network modeling relationship between inputs and state mapping plane obtained by FDA–t-SNE for visual industrial process monitoring"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1568494617304337).

# Supporting information
The animated plotted results are too large to append here. So we upload the zip file to the Google Drive(https://drive.google.com/file/d/12Q0XIJyz3zHpquO3cS-OUt3deAYGALJk/view?usp=sharing)

We have also [released a dataset] in the folder Data for researchers to study their behaviors.

## Installation

**Requirements**:
- Python >= 3.8
- PyTorch >= 1.12

### Work with us

Please [let us know a1714170867@163.com] if you’re doing interesting research with or working on applications of Gaussian Process!  We’re especially interested in hearing from and potentially working with those who are studying
- Statistical analysis
- The extent of extrapolation performance in GP
- Some other applications in numerical analysis using GP
